# Pool Table App

* **Purpose of the app:** 

  The Pool Hall Oversight Menu is a Python clone of an application originally created in C by my DigitalCrafts cohort instructor, ![Mohammed Azam](https://github.com/azamsharp), back in 2003.  His original application was used to help manage the student union pool hall at the University of Houston for several years. We were asked to recreate it given nothing but the project requirements.

  Employees can check out a table to players, see how much they owe for their time played when they return, and clear that table in the system to be reassigned. The app also writes to and reads from a JSON document whenever a table is checked out or returned, so if power is lost or the computer crashes, a record is maintained.

* **Languages/Tools Used:**

  Python, Github, VSCode
